# PhemtoCMS &ndash; Introduction

Yet another PHP-based super-simple flat-file CMS? You bet. But we guess you haven't seen one which includes multi-language support and full-text search out of the box, with an easy-to-use plugin system.

Since there is no backend, create and open files via your file manager or FTP program and edit them in a text editor of your choice. All config and content files should be encoded as **UTF-8 without BOM**, which has evolved into the de facto standard for web content.

> <a name="note-about-notepad"></a> **Note to Windows users:** The default editor *Notepad* is unable to handle this encoding. We recommend installing [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) instead. It's fast, free and open source.
